# SMTLIB Syntax

This package contains [SMTLIB](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/) syntax highlighting
for Sublime Text 3.

## Quickstart

This package is not yet in [package control](https://packagecontrol.io/), so it
must be installed manually:

    git clone https://github.com/Calvin-L/sublime-smtlib.git

Then move the `sublime-smtlib` folder to Sublime Text's [packages
folder](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/packages.html).  The packages folder
location varies by platform so it is not documented here.

## Notes

 - The highlighting matches files with the `.smt2` extension.
